## 📌 **Thesis Overview**
This research presents the **design, modeling, and control** of a **self-balancing unicycle robot**, integrating **classical control methods** (LQR) and **deep reinforcement learning (DDPG)** for balance and maneuverability.

### 🔍 **Key Contributions**
- ✅ **Unicycle Robot Design:** A **compact, reaction-wheel-based** unicycle developed using **SolidWorks** and **3D printing**.
- ✅ **Mathematical Modeling:** Developed a **nonlinear dynamic model** using **Lagrange mechanics**.
- ✅ **Control Strategies:**
  - **Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)** – Model-based optimal control.
  - **Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)** – Model-free reinforcement learning approach.
    
- ✅ **Simulation & Testing:**
  - MATLAB Simulink for **LQR-based control**.
  - PyBullet physics engine with Python for **deep reinforcement learning**.
  - **Real hardware testing** on a self-built **unicycle prototype**.
    
- ✅ **Performance Comparison:** Evaluated **stability, robustness, and external disturbances** for both control approaches.
